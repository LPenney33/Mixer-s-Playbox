Reflection - Gavin


Team:
	I think this project went alright. It could have been better but for what I have done I think I did pretty well for myself. This project could have gone a lot better if
	everyone in the project had:
								1. Actually showed up to class consistently.
								2. Did their part in the project with having to be begged.
								3. Played their leadership role without having to be told to.

Of course there are plenty of other things that could have been done better. I'm not perfect but for the team I had chosen, and the ambitious project we had to do, I think I did pretty well.


Roadblocks:
	One of the biggest issues with this project was both the animation of the Artificial Entities in the game and the implementation of multiplayer in each minigame.


Final Thoughts:
	Overall this project was decent but I would probably only work with one person from my team again.
