Reflection - Daniel



Team:
	Overall the team was pretty good, I think Inder could've done more, but I probably could've as well.

Roadblocks:
	The hardest part was most definitely making the AI and figuring out the death detection.

My thoughts throughout:
	To begin the project, I was expecting it to be much easier. Overcoming the 3D stuff, it was definitely difficult. I never realized how much I have to learn about coding. Honestly, I felt like I could've pulled my weight more, but it wasnt the worst. The hardest part, in my opinion, was just figuring out how to actually do everything in 3d, having to detect when it's red light and kill the player, and then having the AI die when it's detected moving. It surprised me how easy it was to make the actual map and stuff. But now I definitely know to rely less on AI and to actually attempt to learn on my own. Overall I'll use the lessons from this project in future endeavors.


Overall this project proved a lot of difficulties, although, 3D is definitely my goto for making games.
