Reflection - Luke

I thought the project went really well! I tried my best to make the game without using AI for my part of the code. Making the game 3D was a good challenge that I think really
helped with my understanding of the code. It was hard to figure out some elements of the 3D aspect but I ended up with a finished game which is fun and interesting to play.
Our team worked well too, me with color switch, Gavin with Tag, and Daniel with Red Light Green Light. I think we all contributed something special to make the game how it
is and I would definitely work with them again.
